    # This component creates a native color picker with <input type="color" /> with a valueLink
    #
    # The native color picker sends change events too quickly, and the default behavior was causing us
    # to not render any frames while the color picker was changing, because as soon as one update would
    # finish, we'd get another.  I think this was preventing the renderer from getting a clean time point
    # with no js to render a frame, although I need to look into that further.  It's likely that if we
    # improve our renderer policy, we won't need this component.
    #
    # We debounce updates from the color picker to get around the issue discussed above.  We debounce to
    # the next animation frame.  I chose animation frame because presumably anything faster would happen
    # in between frames, and not be seen by the user.  There's nothing fundamentally important about it
    # being on an animation frame; a setTimeout should work just as well.
    #
    # The way we do debouncing on a valueLink is to keep track of what the surrounding application "thinks"
    # our value should be in @lastRequestedValue.  If we get a componentDidUpdate to set our value to a
    # different value than the application thought we were already in, someone else probably changed the
    # value elsewhere, and we should take notice and change our value to that new value.  We drop any
    # pending updates, because the update from "outside" came the updates we're buffering, and we'll
    # resolve the conflict by taking the last write.  Otherwise we do debouncing normally, buffering
    # changes until we get the firing event (animation frame).
